Demonstrate wave superposition through several views.

DEVELOPERS:
The program uses both the Qt 4.5 and the Qwt 5.2.0 scientific computing plugin for Qt. You will need to modify the project (.pro) file depending on where you install Qwt. I always use a static build of Qwt (just seems to work more consistently). Just make sure that the you adjust QWT_ROOT to the Qwt folder on your computer.

NOTE: This was all done on a Mac - Windows user's are probably a bit different.
